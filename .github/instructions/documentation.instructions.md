All documentation should be stored in the `docs/` directory, but the `README.md` and `.devcontainer/README.md` and the `CHANGELOG.md`.

All documentation should be written in .md markdown files. Mermaid diagrams inside of the markdown files should be used where appropriate to illustrate complex concepts, architectures, or workflows.

`README.md`should provide a high-level overview of the project, its purpose, and how to get started, as well as references to deep dives for specific features or components. These deep dive documentation files are always located in the `docs/` directory. 

`.devcontainer/README.md` should provide instructions specific to the development container environment, including how to set it up, how to use it for development, and any environment-specific considerations.

`CHANGELOG.md` format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

All documentation in the `docs/` directory should have a speaking filename and a **Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD date at the top of the file. 

General rules:
- clear, precise and technical tone, not promotional
- avoid redundancies
