  "analysisInsights": "Certainly! Based on your input, here\u2019s an analysis of the COBOL project\u2019s dependency structure:\n\n---\n\n## Dependency Structure Analysis\n\n### 1. Data Flow Dependencies Between Copybooks\n\n**hello.cbl uses:**  \nNo copybooks are listed as being used by \u0060hello.cbl\u0060. This means:\n- There are **no data flow dependencies** between \u0060hello.cbl\u0060 and any copybooks.\n- All data definitions and logic are likely self-contained within the program file.\n\n### 2. Potential Circular Dependencies\n\n- **No copybooks referenced:**  \n  Since \u0060hello.cbl\u0060 does not use any copybooks, there is **no risk of circular dependencies** in this file.\n- **Project-wide:**  \n  If other files or copybooks exist, circular dependencies could arise if copybooks include each other recursively. However, for \u0060hello.cbl\u0060 alone, this is not an issue.\n\n### 3. Modularity Recommendations\n\n- **Current State:**  \n  The program is **not modularized** via copybooks. All code is in a single file.\n- **Recommendation:**  \n  - **Introduce copybooks** for common data structures (e.g., customer records, error messages) and shared procedures.\n  - This will improve maintainability, enable reuse, and make future changes easier.\n  - Modularization also helps with team development and testing.\n\n### 4. Legacy Patterns Affecting Dependencies\n\n- **No legacy copybook usage detected:**  \n  Legacy COBOL often relies heavily on copybooks for data definitions, sometimes leading to tightly coupled code. Since \u0060hello.cbl\u0060 does not use copybooks, it avoids these legacy coupling issues.\n- **Potential Issues:**  \n  - If the project grows, lack of copybooks may lead to duplicated code and harder maintenance.\n  - Legacy patterns to watch for in other files: copybooks with overlapping data names, global variables, or procedural code in copybooks.\n\n---\n\n## Summary \u0026 Recommendations\n\n- **hello.cbl** is self-contained, with no copybook dependencies.\n- **No circular dependencies** or legacy copybook coupling in this file.\n- **Modularity can be improved** by introducing copybooks for shared data and logic.\n- **Project-wide:** Review other files for copybook usage to ensure modularity and avoid circular dependencies.\n\n**Action:**  \nIf the project is expected to grow, start modularizing with copybooks and establish clear dependency boundaries to maintain a clean architecture.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide more files or copybook usage details, I can give a deeper analysis!",
