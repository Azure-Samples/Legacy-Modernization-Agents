## Recommendations

- Add more edge case tests to validate boundary conditions and unusual inputs.
- Review generated tests and enhance with domain-specific scenarios.
- Run tests regularly during development to catch regressions early.
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for critical business operations.

## Running Tests

```bash
# dotnet test
# dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
# dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~SpecificTest
```
